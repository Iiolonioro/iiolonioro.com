title: Dignified Data Environment
---


A Dignified Data Environment is like a card game where
multiple players take turns adding cards to the table
and reacting to those changes according to some rules.


Play proceeds by players adding cards to the table, each one containing a
statement of the form "I, <ID>, assert <JSON> with evidence <JSON>", where
<ID> resolves to
with a sense of rules.


It provides a cache and cache update history for all JSON-LD schema lookups.

## Ecosystems, Environment, Engines, Exchange, Ecology

I settled on Environment.
* Ecosystem fits well, and we attempt to systematically align our use of
  the term Ecosystem intending

## What is Digital Dignity

## Establishment of a Governance Framework
 * A DDE MUST have a governance framework.
 * This MUST be supported by a GIT API without further regard to implementation.

### Metamodel Skeleton


### Trust over IP Layer 3, 4 - ish



#### Yes, compliance, support, integration are sought
It is just not clear what that means right now.
### Use of Agile Legislation



## Assertion Ledger, Revocation and Current State

Data Exchange is driven by the assertion of new information, which takes the
form of VC submission, establishment of revocation and control metrics,
storing of the VC in the appropriate issuer vault, and indexing it according
to the configured index.

Each submission creates a delta against the current state of indices, and
potentially identifies conflicts. If there are no conflicts, then the assertion
is integrated into the current state.

At this point, workflow handlers are dispatched using a simple rules engine
approach.  This handles notifications of change, including revocation, as
well as the ability to trigger task workflows and tag data for secondary
inspection.

### Submission and Gating

Every submission to a DDE

## Directory Management and Indexing
The governance framework provides a function (assertion)=>{directory-name:view}
so that, when an assertion

## Consent Ubiquity

Every datum within a DDE has an origin, and with that origin comes attestations
of identity linking the datum to the world beyond the DDE, to the entities
defined by the existing world of trust and corruption.

Every datum records the answer to the question, "who

"is this datum currently
authorized for use in these conditions by this requestor" -
